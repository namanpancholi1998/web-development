        Inline Elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much
        width necessary.

      <p>
        Block Level Elements are those that start on a new line and take up the
        entire width of their container by default. They essentially claim all
        the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes
        after them to a new line.
