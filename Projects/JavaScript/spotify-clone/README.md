# Spotify-Clone

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In my journey to master coding, I embarked on a project that entailed crafting a fundamental Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This endeavor served as a testament to my prowess in front-end web development. The outcome? A dynamic and responsive web application that beckons users to revel in their favorite tunes. With HTML and CSS, I meticulously sculpted the interface, while JavaScript breathed life into the project, facilitating user interaction through intuitive playback controls like play, pause, and skip. Along the way, I honed my skills in version control, deftly navigating the realm of Git and GitHub.s
