    <div>
      <h1 id="classId">Classes</h1>
      <p class="para">
        The class attribute lets you give the smae name to multiple HTML
        elements. That way, you can easily change their looks or behavior all at
        once. Classes are not unique and can be assigned to multiple elements.
        They are generally used for applying the same styles or behaviors to a
        group of elements.
